# SubRequestForm

This file is a Google Script for the APSubs Google Spreadsheet.
I am sharing it to show an example of my coding ability.

The first sheet is a form. The subsequent sheets have a list of contact information teachers and subs for different disciplines. I.e., there is a 'Handstand' sheet that has the email and phone numbers of all the current handstand teachers and the contact information for people who are qualified to substitute teach a handstand class.

The script runs when the form changes. It populates a dropdown list with all the different sheets of the spreadsheet. 
When you select a sheet, the contact information for the teachers and subs gets copied to the form, and the email message gets updated with the class that needs a sub.
You can add multipile classes, and the script will remove duplicate subs and teachers, and will remove empty values.
The form gives you the option to email teachers, subs or teachers and subs.

For questions please get in touch with me!
